                                    their presence and the webs they leave can be unsettling for many. Our integrated

                                    problematic areas and locate any Mosquito and their webs so they can be removed.</p>
                                <p>Mosquitoes (or mosquitos) are members of a group of almost 3,600 species of small

                                    family Culicidae (from the Latin culex meaning "gnat").</p>
                                <p>The mosquito's saliva is transferred to the host during the bite, and can cause an
                                    itchy rash. In addition, many species
                                    can ingest pathogens while biting,and transmit them to future hosts. In this way,
                                    mosquitoes are
                                    important vectors of parasitic diseases such as malaria and filariasis,

                                    alongside Culicinae, indicating the split between these two subfamilies occurred

                                    ago.[14] Molecular estimates suggest that the split between the two subfamilies
                                    occurred 197.5 million years ago, during
                                    the Early Jurassic, but that major diversification did not take place until the

                                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                                <p>Not all mosquitoes bite. Only female mosquitoes take blood meals. This is because
                                    they need the protein in blood,
                                    composed of amino acids, to develop eggs. Some female mosquitoes require a blood
                                    meal to reproduce the first time. All
                                    female mosquitoes require a blood meal to reproduce a second time.</p>
                                <p>Human blood is the meal of choice for many female mosquitoes, although the reasons
                                    for this are not fully understood.
                                    Many scientists believe that humans have ingredients in their blood that lead to the
                                    more successful production of
                                    larvae. However, this type of mosquito behavior is unpredictable because not all
                                    mosquitoes prefer humans.</p>
                                <p>Every time a female mosquito bites, she takes about 3 milligrams of blood. This
                                    number is trivial in comparison to the
                                    amount of blood in the human body, but it can equal up to four times her actual
                                    weight. It is the equivalent to one
                                    human eating 400 pounds of steak.</p>
                                <p>While the amount of blood mosquitoes draw is insignificant to many humans, if
                                    numerous mosquitoes are all feeding off of
                                    the same food source, the amount of blood lost can be dangerous for some.
                                </p>
                                <p>While female mosquitoes need blood for egg production, they do not use it for their
                                    own nutritional benefit. Instead,
                                    both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar and water.</p>
                                <h3>Infestations</h3>
                                <p>Infestations occur with a sudden increase in the mosquito population. People will
                                    notice an increase in the number of
                                    bites they are experiencing when outdoors. Itching is the most prevalent symptom of
                                    a mosquito bite. Warmer weather is
                                    the time when the mosquito population is most active. Seasons, when heavy rains are
                                    accompanied by flooding also seem to
                                    attract mosquitoes. Flood water is the perfect breeding ground for them. If there is
                                    a section of a home’s yard where
                                    flooding occurs, the stagnant water left behind are the causes of mosquito
                                    infestations.</p>
                                <p>Wherever there is stagnant water, that’s where mosquitoes thrive. The incidence of a
                                    mosquito infestations grows during
                                    the wetter seasons of the year requiring control. Damp, hot climates attract
                                    mosquitoes providing them the perfect
                                    breeding grounds to breed which are the causes of mosquito infestations. To avoid
                                    the nuisances associated with an
                                    infestation contact a professional mosquito control team to rid the yard of these
                                    infuriating pests.</p>

                                <h3>Bites and Treatment</h3>
                                <h4>a) Mosquito bites</h4>

                                <p>Bites from mosquitoes carrying certain viruses or parasites can cause severe illness.
                                    Infected mosquitoes in many parts
                                    of the world transmit West Nile virus to humans. Other mosquito-borne infections
                                    include yellow fever, malaria and some
                                    types of brain infection (encephalitis). Generally, mosquito bites simply appear as
                                    a small itchy bump, but some people
                                    can have more intense reactions to the mosquito bites if they are allergic. Although
                                    a mosquito bite itself is harmless,
                                    mosquitoes are capable of transmitting serious diseases through these bites, such as
                                    malaria, yellow fever and West Nile
                                    virus.</p>
