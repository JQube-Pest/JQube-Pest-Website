                                <p>Termites are small insects that live in colonies and have distinct castes (eusocial)
                                    and feed on wood or other dead
                                    plant matter, occurring on every continent except Antarctica.Owing to their
                                    wood-eating habits, many termite species can do significant damage to unprotected
                                    buildings and other
                                    wooden structures.Termites play an important role as decomposers of wood and
                                    vegetative material, and the conflict with
                                    humans occurs where structures and landscapes containing structural wood components,
                                    cellulose derived structural
                                    materials and ornamental vegetation provide termites with a reliable source of food
                                    and moisture.</p>

                                    makes it difficult to detect. They can
                                    often be easily mistaken for ants. Most householders dismiss the termites as pesky
                                    ants and that leads to not taking any
                                    preventive or extermination measures. Thus, termite infestations can be grown
                                    exponentially as a result. The feeding
                                    habits are capable of causing costly damage to property.</p>
                                <p>Although termites feed on cellulose, found in wood but homes constructed primarily of
                                    wood are not the only structures
                                    threatened by termite activity. They are equally capable of damaging mud tubes,
                                    paper, insulation. Swimming pool liners
                                    and filtration systems Homes made from other materials also host termite
                                    infestations, as these insects are capable of
                                    traversing through plaster, metal siding and more. Termites then feed on cabinets,
                                    floors, ceilings and wooden furniture
                                    within these homes. The type of foundation your property is built on, has a big
                                    impact on how easy it may be for
                                    termites to gain entry in search of food. Although a lot of foundations nowadays are
                                    made of concrete - and termites do
                                    not feed on concrete - however, they can squeeze into any crack within these
                                    concrete blocks and from there gain access
                                    to floor beam, which are still made of wood. If you are building an extension,
                                    laying a chemical termite barrier beneath
                                    the concrete slab in order to prevent termites from traveling through foundation
                                    cracks. Homes with crawl spaces appear
                                    to be at greater risk of damage as their foundations are still traditionally made of
                                    wood.</p>

                                the veneer cracks and the maze-like tunnels beneath become visible. Such damage is

                                thousands of dollars in damage,
                                without anyone even knowing. Thus, it’s important to get a termite inspection done by a
                                licensed pest professional every
                                one to three years to keep the property safe from termites. However, there are also some
                                red flags signalling the
                                presence of termites that homeowners can keep an eye out for on a regular basis. Here
                                are the top five signs of termite
                                infestation to look out for in your home.</p>

                            <p>These are too small for humans to see, found mainly in places such as baseboards,
                                interior walls, window sills, under
                                wooden floors, crawl spaces, and soffit areas. Occasionally, you may find signs of

                                delicacies inside your home either; decks, patios, porches, tree stumps, sheds, and
                                garages are also termite hotspots.</p>
                            <p>The first and most obvious sign of termite infestation are small, clear insect wings
                                found scattered throughout the
                                home's exterior and sometimes in the interior. Termites create new nests by flying to
                                nearby locations; once they've
                                landed at the perfect structure, they'll shed their wings and begin to reproduce.</p>

                                tunnels. These pencil-sized tubes are found protruding from exterior walls and provide

                                Termite inspectors will also check for signs of “swarmer’s.” These are the members of

                                insects will swarm, that implies leaving the original nest, when it’s time for them to
                                venture out and start their own
                                colonies. If termites are swarming, inspectors will either see them flying around or
                                they will see little piles of
                                termite wings in places like window sills and crawl spaces (when they drop their wings,
                                that means they have found a

                            <p>While you should leave termite removal to the professionals, knowing the methods they
                                will use can help you in

                                it from recurring. </p>
                            <p>One popular method on how to get rid of termites involves treating the soil around your
                                house with a termite
                                insecticide, such as imidacloprid or fipronil. Wood can also be treated directly if
                                termites are inside. </p>
                            <p>Termite baits are strategically placed around your yard to lure termites in. Once there,
                                the termites are covered with a
                                slow-acting insecticide or insect growth regulator. They then return to the colony and
                                poison the other termites.</p>
