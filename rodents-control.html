                                    treatment plan to eliminate all rodents from your home or business.</p>
                                <p>Rodents are extremely diverse in their ecology and lifestyles and can be found in
                                    almost every terrestrial habitat,
                                    including human-made environments.</p>
                                <p>Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They
                                    use their sharp incisors to gnaw
                                    food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant
                                    material, but some have more varied diets.</p>
                                <p>Some rodent species are serious agricultural pests, eating large quantities of food
                                    stored by humans.</p>
                                <p>Rodents are also significant vectors of disease.The black rat, with the fleas that it
                                    carries, plays a primary role in
                                    spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries
                                    the organisms responsible
                                    for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents
                                    carry hantaviruses, including
                                    the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents also
                                    help to transmit diseases
                                    including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme
                                    disease, Omsk hemorrhagic
                                    fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted
                                    fever, and West Nile virus.</p>

                                <p>Rats and mice are both rodents, so look similar - the biggest difference is their
                                    size. Rats are larger and heavier
                                    while mice have smaller slender bodies. Mice also have long slender tails (for their
                                    body size) covered in hair compared
                                    to rat tails which are shorter, thicker and hairless.</p>
                                <p>Rats and mice are destructive pests that can spread disease, contaminate food, and
                                    destroy property. The rodent
                                    population grow rapid, Thus, its advisable to targret them when they are smaller in
                                    number before it becomes a full
                                    blown infestation.A successful and effective rodent control strategy typically
                                    involves sanitation measures, rodent
                                    proofing and population reduction (trapping).</p>
                                <h3>Rodent Identification</h3>
                                <p>Due to their damaging habits and tendency to carry diseases, mice and rats are some
                                    of the worst pests to have in homes
                                    and businesses. Our this guide will help you identify any uninvited guests you may
                                    have on your property, allowing you
                                    to keep your home or business pest-free.</p>
                                <h3>Rat Infestation and damage</h3>
                                <p>The most obvious sign of a rat infestation is the presence of dead or living rats.
                                    Rats prefer to hide, given enough
                                    space, so if rats are observed in plain sight, it is likely that a full-blown
                                    infestation already exists. When space
                                    becomes limited due to increased population, rats are forced out into the open. Rat
                                    droppings may be present, indicating
                                    a healthy, feeding rat population. Rats also tend to leave dirt or grease marks
                                    along walls and floorboards.</p>
                                <p>You may never see a mouse or rat unless an infestation is severe. Look for signs of
                                    rat or mouse infestation:</p>

                                <h3>Rat Bites and Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Rats can spread disease through biting or contact with their fecal matter or
                                    droppings. They can cause damage through
                                    their gnawing and feeding on everything from electrical wires to crops. They can be
                                    carriers of many serious diseases.
                                    Among the diseases rats can transmit to humans or livestock are murine typhus,
                                    leptospirosis, salmonellosis (food
                                    poisoning), and rat bite fever. Both roof and Norway rats can carry the Plague.</p>
                                <h3>Treatment :</h3>
                                <p>Discourage rats and mice from taking up residence on your property by removing food
                                    and water sources, and items that
                                    can provide them shelter:</p>

                                <p>Most rodent problems involve one of three common rodent pests... house mice,
                                    Norway rats or roof rats. While they are
                                    all rodents, each has its own unique physical characteristics and behavior. In
                                    addition, you may have problems caused my
                                    Meadow Voles or Moles. The first step in addressing a rodent problem is to
                                    correctly identify the pest species you are
                                    dealing with.</p>
                                <h3>House Mouse</h3>

                                <p>The house mouse is easy to recognize, generally 16-18 cm in length and black or
                                    dusty gray in color. It is a nibbler.
                                    Inquisitive, though it stays close to its nest, which is typically 10-30 ft from
                                    a food and water source. Mice typically
                                    make their nests from string, shredded paper or straw. Its food preferences
                                    include grains, cereals, meats, fish, etc.</p>
                                <h3>Norway Rat</h3>
                                <p>The Norway rat is a large rodent, usually 30-45 cm in length, weighing 10-17
                                    ounces with reddish brown fur. Norway rats
                                    typically nest in burrows 90-450 ft from a food and water source. With its
                                    powerful front teeth, a Norway rat can gnaw
                                    through wood, electrical cables, pipes and other objects. It is very suspicious
                                    of anything new in its environment. Its
                                    food preferences include grains, meats, fish, almost anything.</p>
                                <h3>Roof Rat</h3>
                                <p>The black roof rat is smaller, weighing 6-9 ounces, has a thin body, pointy nose,
                                    large ears and tail, and is dark gray
                                    in color. It nests in trees/rooftops 100-300 ft from a food or water source. Its
                                    food preferences include fruits,
                                    vegetables, grains and seeds.</p>
                                <h3>Rat Behaviour</h3>
                                <p>Rats are exploratory; however, at the same time, they are naturally neophobic
                                    (the fear and avoidance of new objects).
                                    Neophobia is a survival mechanism to protect from the new and unknown and often
                                    occurs when rats are presented with
                                    freshly placed rodenticide bait or bait box or monitoring devices. Thus, they
                                    often avoid traps and baits for several
                                    days or more following their initial placement.</p>
                                <p>The movement of rats and mice is characterised by a 24-hour pattern (circadian
                                    rhythm). Rats leave their nest for food
                                    and water, and breeding. The time when rats are away from their nests is
                                    generally between sunset and sunrise, ie they
                                    are nocturnal, with most of their eating occurring first and last thing during
                                    this period. This moving mainly during
                                    the hours of darkness is a safety mechanism to help protect from predation.</p>
                                <p>A rat’s feeding behaviour reflects its social status, and usually the dominant
                                    rats feed exclusively in darkness while
                                    the subordinate rats feed in the early daylight hours, thus avoiding any
                                    competition or threat from the dominants.
                                    Therefore, the dominant rats will eat the bait first and die first and the
                                    second ‘pulse’ of deaths is from the
                                    juveniles or sub-dominants.</p>
                                <h3>Mice</h3>
                                <p>A mouse xis a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed
                                    snout, small, rounded ears, a
                                    body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best-known mouse species
                                    is the common house mouse. Mice are also
                                    popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common.
                                    They are known to invade homes for food
                                    and shelter.</p>
                                <h3>Mice features</h3>
                                <p>The easiest distinguishing feature is the smaller body size of the house mouse at
                                    3-10 cm long, compared to a rat’s body
                                    length of 16 - 40 cm. However, an adult mouse can be easily confused with a
                                    young rat.</p>
                                <ul class="list-group">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">A mature mouse can be distinguished from a young rat
                                        by its larger ears and longer tail compared to its body length than
                                        the rat.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">A young rat also has distinctly larger feet and head
                                        compared to the body than a mouse.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Mice are usually light grey or brown in colour with
                                        a lighter shade on their bellies.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Mice Behaviour</h3>
                                <p>Mice are nocturnal, meaning they like to sleep during the day. This is why pet mice
                                    or house mice can be heard playing
                                    or foraging during the night. Most wild mice are timid toward humans and other
                                    animals, but they are very social with
                                    other mice. Domestic mice are very friendly toward humans and can make good pets for
                                    older children and adults. When
                                    homes are infested with mice, humans will often find chewed up wires, books, papers
                                    and insulation around their home.
                                    Mice aren't eating these items, they are chewing them into pieces that they can use
                                    to make their nests. This is because
                                    mice nests are made from whatever the female mouse can find.</p>
